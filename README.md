# Pick-and-throw---Kshitij

In this script, players can pick up objects by walking close to them and pressing the E key. The closest object of a specific model (defined in Config.PickupObjects) will be attached to the player's hand bone. Once an object has been picked up, players can throw it by aiming. The object will be detached from the player and thrown in the direction they are facing, with a force determined by the Config.ThrowForce value.
